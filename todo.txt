- The backend will achieve a function to allow courses, so that they can be useful for psychology students.
  - Courses for all the things related to evidence-based practice.
  - It will be a course platform, similar to the Digital House platform.
- It will be developed using Express, TypeScript, and Sequelize with MySQL.
- Check the navbar of "https://blog.logrocket.com/", we could do something similar, like: "MEPC | Blog ... Cursos"
  - I think the most important feature is the blog, setted up with 'tags' ("psicología clínica", "psicología jurídica", and so on).
    - Backend structure:
      - 'users',
      - 'posts',
      - 'tags',
      - 'posts comments',
- Start developing a simple API: 
  - A web app which allow 'users' writing and publishing posts.
- The web app will have different roles.
  - Writers (who only are allowed writing posts).
  - Reviewers (who review the posts made by writes and who access only to writers posts).
  - Admin (who has access to all).
- The web app should have a 'draft' functionality.
- Create a seeder:
  - For a list of basic tags in /tags. 
  - For basic user.
  - For common articles.
  - For common articles users.
  - For some random articles comments.
- Change Sequelize ORM for Prisma ORM.
  - Given that Prisma has better support for TypeScript.
- Implement:
  - Admin CMS
    - The admin CMS will be in the route /admin
  - Authenticated CMS
    - To write posts.
      - In an URL, like "/authenticated/new-article
