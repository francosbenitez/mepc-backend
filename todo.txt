- The backend will achieve a function to allow courses, so that they can be useful for psychology students.
  - Courses for all the things related to evidence-based practice.
  - It will be a course platform, similar to the Digital House platform.
- It will be developed using Express, TypeScript, and Sequelize with MySQL.
- Check the navbar of "https://blog.logrocket.com/", we could do something similar, like: "MEPC | Blog ... Cursos"
  - I think the most important feature is the blog, setted up with 'tags' ("psicología clínica", "psicología jurídica", and so on).
    - Backend structure:
      - 'users',
      - 'posts',
      - 'tags',
      - 'posts comments',
      -
